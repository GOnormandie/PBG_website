## Overview

The rate at which invasive populations spread into new areas is determined by their rates of dispersal and population growth.  Of these two rates, dispersal is almost always the harder to estimate, with the tail of dispersal curves being particularly difficult to quantify.  However, estimates of dispersal are vital for any enterprise that seeks to manage populations, as this information helps identify locations to target and actions to use.  Whether we are looking to control or eradicate an invasive pest species, or to assist a threatened native species, an understanding of dispersal matters.  This project develops cutting edge tools for estimating dispersal, using population genomics data.

## Aims

This project looks to develop new analytical tools for estimating patterns of dispersal based on spatial and genetic datasets. It looks to extend recent developments in this field of research, and evaluate the functionality and accuracy of the new methods against both real and simulated data. To do this, the identification and collection of one or more datasets in study systems (e.g. species and locations) that are both practical and useful to work with is required.

## Objectives

1.	Use ecologically realistic simulations to test the robustness of existing population genetic inference tools.
2.	Extend kin dyad approaches to incorporate mixture distributions and environmental heterogeneity.
3.	Extend kin dyad approaches to use continuous measures of relatedness.
4.	Test these extensions against the criteria used in objective 1.


## Significance

The cost of acquiring large amounts of DNA sequencing data is now so low that it is feasible to rapidly obtain and analyse tens of thousands of loci for many hundreds of individuals.  Data of this kind can be used to estimate not just some mean dispersal rate, but the entire distribution of dispersal distances that occurs in a population.  This distribution – the dispersal kernel – is a keystone piece of information required for spatially explicit population models.  An ability to estimate the dispersal kernel with genetics data is an enabling technology that rapidly opens up a huge range of applications across environment, health, and agriculture.

## Candidate growth and outputs

This candidate will gain highly valuable and transferrable skills in scientific research, population genomics, statistical inference, simulation modelling, and dispersal. High quality, peer-reviewed publications will include internationally relevant manuscripts covering such topics, with research findings presented at relevant local and international conferences as well as more targeted seminars/workshops. The candidate will be engaged in outreach through stakeholder meetings to share data and research highlights as well as hone communication skills and develop relationships with industry partners.

## How to apply

Candidates must have:

- A strong track record in undergraduate studies;
- Honours or Masters by research
- A background or keen interest in ecology, evolution, genetics, statistics, or related discipline.

Applications are open now and will close on the 8th September.
