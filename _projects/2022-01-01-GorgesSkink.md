The Arnhem rock skink (*Bellatorias obiri*) is one of Australia’s most threatened species, and at high risk of becoming extinct by 2040. With very few known records of the species from the past 20 years, and the species only being known to persist at a single location, the species was in dire need of surveys and protection.

Led by Dr Emily Hoffmann, this project worked closely with Traditional Owners to survey areas of Kakadu National Park from which the species was formerly known to occur. These surveys were conducted over the 2022-2023 wet season using camera traps and eDNA analysis. These methods were chosen because active searching produces poor results when the skinks spend so much of their time deep in rock crevices.

## Progress

This project has produced some fantastic results, with camera trapping detecting Arnhem rock skinks at five of the seven historical locations surveyed, where the skinks appear to persist in small numbers. This will allow Kakadu National Park to better protect and manage the species, as well as provide baseline data for future monitoring. Interestingly, eDNA analysis was able to confirm that one collected scat belonged to an Arnhem Land rock skink, but did not detect the species in samples of water and soil collected from in or near crevices that were being actively used. This suggests that eDNA methods may not be effective for targeted or community-level surveys for reptiles in these types of environments.

Further research and monitoring at sites where Arnhem Land rock skinks are known to persist will help to identify whether these populations are continuing to decline, as well as tell us whether factors such as feral cats (*Felis catus*) or inappropriate fire regimes are increasing mortality rates and reducing population growth rates.

While Emily is moving on to new and interesting projects, the various stakeholders, such as Territory NRM, Kakadu NP, and the NT Government, will continue to ensure that this species is prioritised for conservation management and research.
