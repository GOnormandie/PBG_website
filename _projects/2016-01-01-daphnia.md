This project aimed to develop a shared experimental platform, using the well-studied ecological model, Daphnia, to test emergent predictions about evolution on invasion fronts. Evolution happens rapidly on invasion fronts, accelerating the speed and potentially the damage caused by an invasion. By manipulating invasions through an experimental landscape, the project aimed to answer currently infeasible questions, including whether pathogens become more virulent as they spread, and whether evolutionary trade-offs place limits on spread rate. The findings may have implications for the management of phenomena ranging from emergent diseases to invasive pests and malignant growths.

## Progress

This project was a collaboration with the inimitable Matt Hall at Monash University. We developed a powerful new model system for Australian researchers.  The project used this system to address fundamental questions around the ecology and evolution of invasive populations.  We show that spreading pathogens are under fundamentally different evolutionary pressures than endemic pathogens; that pathogens specialise functions across host sexes (using males for dispersal, and females for reproduction); and that host dispersal depends on local conditions.  The project has also developed new theory addressing the nature of natural selection, and evolution on invasion fronts.  The full value of this project will be realised over coming decades as the system is taken up by Australian researchers.

The project supported two PhD students (Sally Drapes, Louise Noergard), two Masters students (Phil Erm, Kim Chhen), and two undergraduate students (Erin Campbell-Hooper, and Tahlia Townsend), as well as several other PhDs that were more peripherally involved.
