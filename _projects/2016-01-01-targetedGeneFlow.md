Biodiversity loss is happening at an unacceptable rate, worldwide. The drivers of this loss—climate change, habitat modification, invasive species, and disease—can be managed, but we urgently need efficient new strategies to mitigate their impact. One emerging conservation strategy is to exploit geographic trait variation. Work in this area currently focuses on the use of geographic variation in climate-relevant traits to mitigate climate change impact. But climate change is not the only threatening process for which geographic variation exists. Geographic variation exists for traits mediating the impact of other drivers of biodiversity loss as well: susceptibility to invasive species; dispersal rate of invasive species; susceptibility to disease, and so on. The possibility exists, therefore, for us to take a more aggressive approach: rather than amplifying rates of natural gene flow and focusing only on climate-relevant traits, we can, instead, broaden the traits we consider, and move variants to wherever they will achieve a desirable conservation outcome. Such an approach &mdash; targeted gene flow &mdash; can be applied to a surprisingly wide range of circumstances, ranging from halting the spread of invasive species, to combatting emergent disease.

## Progress

Geographic variation and local adaptation are ubiquitous within species, but conservation managers currently make no use of this heritable variation. This project developed the idea of targeted gene flow; exploiting natural geographic variation to achieve conservation outcomes. This project &mdash; and ARC Future Fellowship &mdash; developed decision-support tools as well as three empirical case studies: pre-adapting populations to climate change; stopping the advance of cane toads; and preventing and reversing the decline of northern quolls. The tools address the issues of when to time a targeted gene flow action, and where to source appropriate genetic variation. The case studies provide the groundwork for future novel conservation actions in these areas.

The project provided opportunities for four fantastic PhD students (Ella Kelly, Naomi Indigo, Chris Jolly, Adam Smart), a postdoc (Jeff Paril) and developed a new collaboration with Kenbi Rangers.  Our combined work resulted in 27 papers to date.
