Andy is a Research Associate in the Population Biology & Genomics group. His research interests include parasitology, population dynamics, evolution and, most recently, population modelling. He is currently using population models to predict the spread of invasive species across the landscape, such as the recently introduced shothole borer beetle in WA. Previously, he was a Research Fellow at the Melbourne University and at Deakin University, where he specialised in modelling the epidemiology of salmon parasites affecting aquaculture in the northern hemisphere. He completed his PhD at the University of Melbourne in 2022 (combining experimental and modelling approaches to explore the evolution of salmon parasites), and prior to that completed his Masters researching parasite diversity across invasive house gecko populations.
