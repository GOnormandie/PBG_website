Ben is a Professor at Curtin University's School of Molecular and Life Sciences. He is a population biologist with a background in ecology and evolution, and is particularly interested in how spatial processes influence population and evolutionary dynamics. Ben started his professional life as a field biologist, but has slowly morphed into a modeler. He is interested in developing models describing population and evolutionary dynamics, and applying these to real problems in agriculture, health, and environment.
