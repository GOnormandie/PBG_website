Welcome to Population Biology and Genomics (PGB) @ Curtin University! Our goal is to better understand population level processes in ecology and evolution, and convert this understanding into practical outcomes for the environment, health, and agriculture. With a focus on building functional collaborations, developing novel analytical approaches, and using modern technologies, we strive to push the boundaries of science and make tangible contributions to the world. We tackle complex challenges and explore innovative solutions to real-world problems, including the decline and extinction of species that is occurring globally. We are driven by a passion for discovery and a love of the natural world.
Here at PBG, we leverage a multidisciplinary approach, using a combination of ecological data, spatial and temporal processes, landscape and population genomic methodologies, and simulation approaches to better understand how populations operate in modern contexts. Our research focuses on terrestrial ecosystems, although we occasionally delve into watery environments for a good cause. Importantly, we believe that a strong foundational understanding of biological, ecological, and evolutionary processes is necessary for accurate inference, and so we emphasise the importance of understanding natural history.
We maintain strong collaborative links to industry, academia, and governmental organisations to improve our science and translate findings into practical applications for meaningful impact. In this spirit, we aim to foster an inclusive and collaborative environment, where creativity and intellectual curiosity thrive, nurturing the next generation of scientists and innovators.
