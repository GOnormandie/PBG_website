I was recently invited to give a talk to the Darling Range Branch of the WA Naturalists' Club.

Seeing as everybody loves carnivorous marsupials, I decided to discuss some of the population demographic and genomic work I have been doing on the northern quoll (*Dasyurus hallucatus*). This is a wonderful native mammal that is found from Queensland across northern Australia all the way to the Pilbara region of WA. I met a range of lovely and interesting Club members from the Perth region and look forward to attending more club meetings in the future.

The Darling Range Branch meets in Kalamunda on the second Friday of the month, and hosts a range of fantastic talks and presentations on a variety of natural history topics. More information can be found [here](https://www.wanaturalists.org.au/branches-groups/darling-range/)
