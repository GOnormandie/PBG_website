Brenton was recently invited to give a small talk at a symposium being held at the official signing of the 2024-2028 Western Australian Biodiversity Science Institute (WABSI) joint venture agreement.

The symposium showcased Early Career Researchers from each of the WABSI Partner Organisations, including CSIRO, Curtin University, DBCA, DPIRD, DWER, Edith Cowan University, Murdoch University, The University of Western Australia, and the WA Museum.

Brenton gave a quick overview of his recent work on northern quoll population size trajectories, as well as the spread and impacts that cane toads have had on biodiversity in northern Australia.
