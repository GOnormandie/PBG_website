<p>Rather than cut and paste, here's a link to&nbsp;a <a href="https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/articles/the-genetic-backburn" target="_blank">quick article explaining the idea</a>. Read it and then read on...</p>

<p>How on earth did we ever come up with this idea? &nbsp;Well, it happened&nbsp;at a low moment. &nbsp;Reid Tingley, Darren Southwell, and myself were camping our way across the 400km strip of country between Port Hedland and Broome. &nbsp;We'd been looking at the country and talking to people about&nbsp;the feasibility of setting up a waterless barrier to stop toads getting to the Pilbara. &nbsp;There had been highs ("it will work!") and lows (but not at this exact place because [insert issue x]"). &nbsp;Between talking to people, we just camped at random places along a very quiet stretch of highway.</p>

<p>We had had a bad&nbsp;few hours for some reason or another. &nbsp;It was dark, we had tumbled out of the car and were sitting in the sand amongst the saltbush near a bore somewhere on Anna Plains Station. &nbsp;We were too tired (and probably too filthy) to make dinner so were just sitting around the fire drinking cask wine instead. &nbsp;We&nbsp;were lamenting the fact that the barrier we needed would have to be so wide. &nbsp;I pointed out that it only needed to be so wide because it had to stop these crazy invasion front toads with their insane tendency to disperse huge distances; if only we were trying to stop their brethren in QLD that are much more modest dispersers. &nbsp;And then, of course, the idea of translocating QLD toads to the nearside of the barrier---the genetic backburn---appeared, fully formed. &nbsp;Ridiculously obvious in hindsight, but a sufficiently audacious idea&nbsp;that we almost had to step on it before we saw it.</p>

<p>So there's my little allegory about the trials and tribulations of research and how exciting ideas can come from seemingly intractable problems. &nbsp;The story also speaks, I think, to the value of open discussion and friendly banter. &nbsp;Sometimes the vagaries of group conversation take you places you may not have gone otherwise.</p>

<p>Of course not everyone needs company and diversion to hit upon good ideas. &nbsp;Some people don't subconsciously hide from audacious ideas. &nbsp;A few days later we held a workshop in Broome. &nbsp;Rick Shine was there, and Reid was telling him that it was tricky to find a 100km stretch of country that was perfect. &nbsp;Rick proceeded to suggest to Reid that the problem was that we were trying to stop the invasion front toads. &nbsp;Why didn't we consider bringing some QLD toads over?</p>

<p>At least we knew it was an idea whose time had come.</p>
