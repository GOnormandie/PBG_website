Congratulations to Tash Harrison, this year's recipient of the Ada Jackson Irwin Street Commemoration Award in Zoology, at UWA.

Tash will use the award to travel to the Australian Mammal Society conference to present her work.

I dropped in to applaud, but also got to catch up with Tash, Malindi, and Renee while I was there.
