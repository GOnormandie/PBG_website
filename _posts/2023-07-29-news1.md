Ben and Brenton have arrived at Curtin and are working through the onboarding process.  We have been ably assisted by our School business manager, Gail Wescombe.  

We are busy sorting out office space, computers, logins, accounts, lab space, and recruitment (among other things).  One of the first orders of business is this website.

As things come together we will start reaching out to industry and government partners, and start forming up the projects that will form the core parts of the Premier's Science Fellowship.

But first, the basics.
