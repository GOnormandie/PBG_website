Tash is a population and behavioural ecologist with a keen interest in the conservation of Australiaâ€™s unique fauna. She is currently completing her PhD at UWA, where she is working toward understanding the loss of anti-predator responses from havened mammals, along with the drivers and consequences of that loss. She hopes that this project will provide tangible evidence with which to inform the strategic management of threatened mammals. Prior to her PhD, Tash developed her passion for fieldwork and demography while living in the Kalahari Desert studying the behaviour and population dynamics of meerkats.
