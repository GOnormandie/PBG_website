John has a background in parasitology and has experience working on tapeworm epidemiology, genetic diversity and population structure in Asia and Africa. More recently, he developed interest in the application of ecological and computational/statistical approaches in understanding disease spread. His PhD currently seeks to understand the invasion of Anopheles stephensi in Africa, especially where it will spread to next and/or may already have been established. He also aims to explore novel and existing control strategies in managing the vector.
