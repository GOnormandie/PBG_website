Ian has a background in bioinformatics and has experience working in population genomics in falcons and seahorses in Middle East and Asia. In other circles, he's explored research involving antibacterial resistance, microbiome science, and cancer genomics. Lately, he's developed a keen interest in conservation and wildlife genomics. His PhD currently seeks to explore and develop the latest methods for estimating dispersal and gene flow directionality of vertebrates using a combination of landscape genomic and spatial occurrence data in Australia.
