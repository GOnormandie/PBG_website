Marta has background in terrestrial ecology with a keen interest in research focused on invertebrates. For her PhD she is trying to use genetic data of invasive invertebrates from the area of Perth to determine how landscape features shape their dispersal. By using resistance surface modelling to investigate patterns of connectivity and dispersal she will try to create a method to better monitor the spread of invasive invertebrates and prevent their further expansion in Australia.
