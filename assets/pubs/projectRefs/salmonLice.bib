	abstract = {Sea cage fish farming is typically open to the environment, with disease transmission possible between farmed and wild hosts. In salmonid aquaculture, salmon louse Lepeophtheirus salmonis infestations cause production losses, reduce welfare for farmed fish and increase infestation rates for wild fish populations. The high density of hosts in farms likely also shifts the coevolutionary arms race between host and parasite, with ecological and evolutionary consequences for the salmon louse. Using farm-reported salmon and louse abundances and publicly reported estimates of wild salmonid host abundances and the salmon lice they carry, we estimated (1) the relative abundance of farmed and wild salmonid hosts and (2) the relative importance of each for the abundance of salmon lice for the coastal zone of Norway from 1998 to 2017. Farmed hosts increased in importance over time with the expansion of the industry. From 2013 to 2017, farmed salmonids outnumbered wild salmonids by 267-281:1. By 2017, farmed salmonids accounted for 99.6\% of available hosts and produced 99.1\% of adult female salmon lice and 97.6\% of mated (ovigerous) adult female salmon lice in Norwegian coastal waters. The persistent dominance of farmed hosts has clear implications: (1) management decisions that aim to limit lice abundance can be guided by lice data from farms alone, as lice on wild salmonids make a trivial contribution to the national lice population; and (2) strategies to prevent or treat lice infestations are vulnerable to the evolution of resistance, as the pool of wild hosts is inconsequential and will not act as a refuge large enough to stem the evolution of resistance. As the Norwegian salmon industry expands and salmon lice infestations continue, farmed salmon will drive the ecology and evolution of salmon lice.},

	abstract = {The evolution of pest resistance to management strategies is a major challenge for farmed systems. Mitigating the effects of pest adaptation requires identifying the selective pressures imposed by these strategies. In Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) aquaculture, barriers are used to prevent salmon louse (Lepeophtheirus salmonis) larvae (copepodids) from entering salmon cages. These barriers are effective against shallow-swimming copepodids, but those swimming deeper can pass underneath and infest salmon. Laboratory experiments suggest that depth regulation in copepodids is a variable behavioural trait with a genetic basis. We used biological–hydrodynamic dispersal models to assess how this trait variation alters the dispersion of lice through the ocean environment and into farms. The dispersal of copepodids with 3 behavioural phenotypes (deep, mean or shallow) was modelled over winter–spring and spring–summer periods in a Norwegian fjord system with intensive aquaculture. The infestation pressure of each phenotype on barrier cages was estimated from their modelled depth distributions: copepodids deeper than 10 m were predicted to successfully pass underneath barriers. The deep phenotype was the most abundant below 10 m and reached infestation pressures 3 times higher than that of the mean phenotype. In contrast, the shallow phenotype infestation pressure reached less than half that of the mean phenotype. These differences in relative fitness indicate that barriers can impose strong directional selection on the swimming behaviour of copepodids. The strength of this selection varied seasonally and geographically, with selection for the deep phenotype stronger in winter–spring and at coastal locations than in spring–summer and within fjords. These findings can be applied across farms to slow louse adaptation, by limiting barriers during situations of strong selection, although this must be balanced against trade-offs to short-term efficacy. More broadly, our study highlights new ways in which dispersal models can address evolutionary questions crucial for sustainable parasite management in aquaculture.},

	abstract = {Ectoparasitic salmon lice (Lepeophtheirus salmonis) present a major challenge to Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) aquaculture. The demand for effective louse control has produced diverse management strategies. These strategies essentially impose novel selection pressures on parasite populations, driving the evolution of resistance. Here we assess the potential for salmon lice to adapt to current prevention and control methods. Lice have evolved resistance to at least four of five chemical therapeutants, and use of these chemicals has declined significantly in recent years. The industry has shifted to alternative non-chemical approaches, yet lice may adapt to these as well. Early research suggests that phenotypic variation exists in the louse population upon which non-chemical selection pressures could act and that this variation may have a genetic basis. From the existing evidence, as well as an examination of evolutionary processes in other relevant parasite and pest systems, we conclude that the evolution of non-chemical resistance is an emergent concern that must be considered by the industry. We recommend areas for focused research to better assess this risk. It is also important to determine whether phenotypic shifts in response to non-chemical selection may shift the ecological niche of the parasite, as this may have cascading effects on wild salmon populations. We also recommend further research to identify strategy combinations that have antagonistic selective effects that slow louse evolution and those with synergistic effects that should be avoided. Greater understanding of evolutionary processes can inform aquaculture policies that counteract the rise of resistant parasite populations.},

	abstract = {In salmon aquaculture, the sustainable management of salmon lice (Lepeophtheirus salmonis) is limited by the adaptive capacity of the parasite. This is evident in the repeated evolution of pesticide resistance in the salmon louse population. To better prepare for resistance, we constructed a numerical metapopulation model that predicts the evolutionary dynamics of lice across an interconnected farm network. This model integrates within-farm population dynamics and between-farm louse dispersal, the latter using outputs from a state-of-the-art particle-tracking model. Distinct from previous metapopulation models, it also simulates spatial and temporal genetic variation arising from selection. The model was parameterized to simulate the evolution of resistance to the pesticide azamethiphos on farms in southern Norway. It successfully reproduced the rapid (within 10 years) evolution of azamethiphos resistance following extensive delousing treatments. It also identified strong spatial patterns in resistance, with regions of high farm connectivity being potential hotspots of louse adaptation. Rates of infestation and evolution were significantly reduced when highly connected farms were excluded from the simulation, compared to when low-connectivity or random sites were excluded. This model can be a valuable tool for coordinating pest management at a regional scale, in a way that slows or prevents the spread of resistance.},
