	abstract = {Invasive species are a leading cause of native biodiversity loss. In Australia, the toxic, invasive cane toad Rhinella marina has caused massive and widespread declines of northern quolls Dasyurus hallucatus. Quolls are fatally poisoned if they mistakenly prey on adult toads. To prevent the extinction of this native dasyurid from the Top End, an insurance population was set up in 2003 on two toad-free islands in Arnhem Land. In 2015, quolls were collected from one of these islands (Astell) for reintroduction. We used conditioned taste aversion to render 22 of these toad-naïve quolls toad averse. Seven quolls received no taste aversion training. The source island was also predator-free, so all quolls received very basic predator-aversion training. In an attempt to re-establish the mainland population, we reintroduced these 29 northern quolls into Kakadu National Park in northern Australia where cane toads have been established for 13 years. The difference in survival between toad-averse and toad-naive quolls was immediately apparent. Toad-naive quolls were almost all killed by toads within 3 days. Toad-averse quolls, on the other hand, not only survived longer but also were recorded mating. Our predator training, however, was far less effective. Dingo predation accounted for a significant proportion of toad-smart quoll mortality. In Kakadu, dingoes have been responsible for high levels of quoll predation in the past and reintroduced animals are often vulnerable to predation-mediated population extinction. Dingoes may also be more effective predators in fire degraded landscapes. Together, these factors could explain the extreme predation mortality that we witnessed. In addition, predator aversion may have been lost from the predator-free island populations. These possibilities are not mutually exclusive but need to be investigated because they have clear bearing on the long-term recovery of the endangered northern quoll.},

	abstract = {If bold animals are more likely to be trapped than shy animals, we take a biased sample of personalities—a problem for behavioural research. Such a bias is problematic, also, for population estimation using mark-recapture models that assume homogeneity in detection probabilities. In this study, we investigated whether differences in boldness result in differences in detection probability in a native Australian rodent, the grassland melomys (Melomys burtoni). During a mark-recapture study of this species, we used modified open field tests to assess the boldness (via emergence, and interaction with a novel object) of melomys trapped on the last night of four trapping nights in each of two trapping sessions. Despite melomys showing repeatable variation in these behavioural traits, neither boldness nor emergence latency had an effect on detection probability, and we found no evidence that detection probability varied between individuals. This result suggests that any neophobia is experienced and resolved in individuals of this species on a scale of minutes, rather than the hours across which traps are made available each night. Our work demonstrates that personality-caused sampling bias may not be inevitable, even in situations where animals are required to respond to novelty to be detected, such as in baited traps. Heterogeneity in personality does not inevitably lead to heterogeneity in detection probability.},

	abstract = {When imperilled by a threatening process, the choice is often made to conserve threatened species on offshore islands that typically lack the full suite of mainland predators. While keeping the species extant, this releases the conserved population from predator-driven natural selection. Antipredator traits are no longer maintained by natural selection and may be lost. It is implicitly assumed that such trait loss will happen slowly, but there are few empirical tests. In Australia, northern quolls (Dasyurus hallucatus) were moved onto a predator-free offshore island in 2003 to protect the species from the arrival of invasive cane toads on the mainland. We compared the antipredator behaviours of wild-caught quolls from the predator-rich mainland with those from this predator-free island. We compared the responses of both wild-caught animals and their captive-born offspring, to olfactory cues of two of their major predators (feral cats and dingoes). Wild-caught, mainland quolls recognized and avoided predator scents, as did their captive-born offspring. Island quolls, isolated from these predators for only 13 generations, showed no recognition or aversion to these predators. This study suggests that predator aversion behaviours can be lost very rapidly, and that this may make a population unsuitable for reintroduction to a predator-rich mainland.},

	abstract = {The invasion of toxic cane toads (Rhinella marina) is a major threat to northern quolls (Dasyurus hallucatus) which are poisoned when they attack this novel prey item. Quolls are now endangered as a consequence of the toad invasion. Conditioned taste aversion can be used to train individual quolls to avoid toads, but we currently lack a training technique that can be used at a landscape scale to buffer entire populations from toad impact. Broad-scale deployment requires a bait that can be used for training, but there is no guarantee that such a bait will ultimately elicit aversion to toads. Here, we test a manufactured bait – a ‘toad sausage’ – in a small captive trial, for its ability to elicit aversion to toads in northern quolls. To do this, we exposed one group of quolls to a toad sausage and another to a control sausage and compared the quolls' predatory responses when presented with a dead adult toad. Captive quolls that consumed a single toad sausage showed a reduced interest in cane toads, interacting with them for less than half the time of their untrained counterparts and showing reduced Attack behaviour. We also quantified bait uptake in the field, by both quolls and non-target species. These field trials showed that wild quolls were the most frequent species attracted to the baits, and that approx. 61\% of quolls consumed toad-aversion baits when first encountered. Between 40\% and 68\% of these animals developed aversion to further bait consumption. Our results suggest that toad-aversion sausages may be used to train wild quolls to avoid cane toads. This opens the possibility for broad-scale quoll training with toad aversion sausages: a technique that may allow wildlife managers to prevent quoll extinctions at a landscape scale.},

Predators also elicit behavioural change in prey populations, via plasticity and rapid evolution, and such behavioural responses by prey may also contribute to trophic cascades. Here we document the effects of a novel predator on the behaviour and demography of a native prey species. We reveal rapid behavioural responses in the prey species (grassland melomys, a granivorous rodent) following the introduction of a novel marsupial predator (northern quoll). Within months of quolls appearing, populations of melomys exhibited reduced survival and population declines relative to control populations. Quoll-exposed populations were also significantly shyer than nearby, predator-free populations of conspecifics. This rapid but generalised response to a novel threat was replaced over the following two years with more threat-specific antipredator behaviours (i.e. predator-scent aversion). Predator-exposed populations, however, remained more neophobic than predator-free populations throughout the study. These behavioural responses manifested rapidly in changed rates of seed predation by melomys across treatments. Quoll-exposed melomys populations exhibited lower per-capita seed take rates, and rapidly developed an avoidance of seeds associated with quoll scent, with discrimination playing out over a spatial scale of tens of metres. Presumably the significant and novel predation pressure induced by the introduction of quolls drove melomys to fine-tune their behavioural response through time as the nature of the threat became clearer. These behavioural shifts could reflect individual plasticity in behaviour or may be adaptive shifts from natural selection imposed by quoll predation. Our study provides a rare insight into the rapid ecological and behavioural shifts enacted by prey to mitigate the impacts of a novel predator and shows that trophic cascades can be strongly influenced by behavioural as well as numerical responses.},

	abstract = {Targeted gene flow is a novel conservation strategy that involves translocating individuals with favourable genes to areas where they will have a conservation benefit. One oft-cited risk of the strategy is the potential for outbreeding depression. Here, we used the northern quoll (Dasyurus hallucatus) as a model to test this possibility for the first time in a field setting. Northern quolls are endangered by the spread of the invasive cane toad (Rhinella marina), which they are fatally poisoned by, if they mistakenly attempt to consume them. There are, however, a small number of quolls that are “toad-smart”—they possess a heritable trait that means they innately do not attack toads. It is this trait we hoped to promote through targeted gene flow. We established a hybrid population (54 toad-smart and toad-naïve northern quolls) and introduced this population onto a small offshore, toad-infested island in 2017. Genetic data suggests an increase in the toad-smart proportion of the genome increasing from 29.4\% in the release population to 40.2\% in the first island generation (F2). Our data demonstrate successful in situ hybridisation between populations, with viable F2 hybrids and backcrosses observed, and some evidence of heterosis (hybrid vigour) in F1 hybrids. The population experienced significant reductions in size over the two years, however, through a combination of toad-mortality, as well as stochastic processes including fire, a cyclone, predation and ineffective breeding, and so small sample sizes hamper our results. Such establishment problems would not occur were we to attempt targeted gene flow into already established quoll populations, and our observation of successful hybridisation suggests targeted gene flow could be a viable strategy in established quoll populations soon to be impacted by toads.},

	abstract = {Cultural adaptation is one means by which conservationists may help populations adapt to threats. A learned behavior may protect an individual from a threat, and the behavior can be transmitted horizontally (within generations) and vertically (between generations), rapidly conferring population-level protection. Although possible in theory, it remains unclear whether such manipulations work in a conservation setting; what conditions are required for them to work; and how they might affect the evolutionary process. We examined models in which a population can adapt through both genetic and cultural mechanisms. Our work was motivated by the invasion of highly toxic cane toads (Rhinella marina) across northern Australia and the resultant declines of endangered northern quolls (Dasyurus hallucatus), which attack and are fatally poisoned by the toxic toads. We examined whether a novel management strategy in which wild quolls are trained to avoid toads can reduce extinction probability. We used a simulation model tailored to quoll life history. Within simulations, individuals were trained and a continuous evolving trait determined innate tendency to attack toads. We applied this model in a population viability setting. The strategy reduced extinction probability only when heritability of innate aversion was low ({\textless}20\%) and when trained mothers trained {\textgreater}70\% of their young to avoid toads. When these conditions were met, genetic adaptation was slower, but rapid cultural adaptation kept the population extant while genetic adaptation was completed. To gain insight into the evolutionary dynamics (in which we saw a transitory peak in cultural adaptation over time), we also developed a simple analytical model of evolutionary dynamics. This model showed that the strength of natural selection declined as the cultural transmission rate increased and that adaptation proceeded only when the rate of cultural transmission was below a critical value determined by the relative levels of protection conferred by genetic versus cultural mechanisms. Together, our models showed that cultural adaptation can play a powerful role in preventing extinction, but that rates of cultural transmission need to be high for this to occur.},

	abstract = {Targeted gene flow is an emerging conservation strategy that involves introducing individuals with particular traits to places where these traits are of benefit. One obvious application is to adapt a recipient population to a known threat, but questions remain as to how best to achieve this. Here, we vary timing and size of the introduction to maximise our objective – survival of the recipient population's genome. We explore a generic population model as well as a specific example – the northern quoll, an Australian marsupial predator threatened by the toxic cane toad. We reveal a trade-off between preserving the recipient genome and reducing population extinction risk, but key management levers can often optimise this so that nearly 100\% of the recipient population's genome is preserved. Any action was better than none but the size of the benefit was sensitive to outbreeding depression, recombination rate, and the timing and size of the introduction.},

	abstract = {Uptake of baits is a key variable in management actions aimed at the vaccination, training, or control of many vertebrate species. Increasingly, however, it is apparent that individuals of the target species vary in their likelihood of taking baits. To optimize a baiting program, knowledge on the rate of bait uptake, how this rate changes with bait availability, and the proportion of the target population that will take a bait is required. The invasive cane toad (Rhinella marina) in Australia is a major threat to northern quolls (Dasyurus hallucatus), which are poisoned when they attack this novel toxic prey item. Conditioned-taste-aversion baits (cane toad sausages) can be delivered in the field to train northern quolls to avoid toads. We conducted a large-scale field trial among 11 sites across one large property in Western Australia from 19–26 July 2017. We used camera traps and statistical modelling to estimate the proportion of baitable animals in the population, their encounter rate with baits, and survival rate of baits in the environment. Population estimates varied at each site from 2.5 to 16.8 quolls per site, resulting in a range among sites of 0.7–4.6 baits available/individual. Approximately 64\% of individual quolls were bait-susceptible. Both encounter rate and bait survival were low, resulting in our baiting regime treating {\textless}30\% of the bait-susceptible population. Using our model parameters, we estimate that we would need to increase our bait density 6-fold to treat all bait-susceptible individuals in the population. Without accounting for heterogeneity in bait-susceptibility, our model would suggest we would need a 10-fold increase in bait density. Thus, accounting for heterogeneity provides a more efficient baiting design. Data and models such as ours provide wildlife managers with information critical to informed decision-making and are fundamental to estimate the cost-efficiency of any baiting campaign. © 2019 The Wildlife Society.},

	abstract = {Context Animals can be taught new behaviours to mitigate threatening processes. However, it is yet to be confirmed if such teaching can be deployed in the field. Here we test this possibility using the invasion of cane toads because they are highly toxic novel prey items to many predators across northern Australia.Aims Research has shown that training predators to avoid toads, using conditioned taste aversion (CTA), significantly improves the survival rates of individuals. We sought to determine if deployment of CTA baits, in situ, could reduce cane toad impacts on a mammalian predator, the northern quoll (Dasyurus hallucatus).Methods The work was conducted in the Kimberley, Western Australia, where we treated three quoll populations with training baits from November 2015–November 2017, and kept four populations as controls. We used camera traps and Bayesian hierarchal modelling to estimate the population size of quolls on up to four occasions before, and two occasions after, cane toad arrival.Key results We observed a 65\% reduction in quoll population size at control sites and a 94\% reduction at treatment sites: a significant effect of aversion training, but in the direction opposite to that expected.Conclusions Two complexities – decay of aversion, and individual variation – together, may explain our result. Our trials indicate that most animals are no longer averse within 120days post-training. Earlier studies indicating that aversion training lasts longer may have inadvertently observed innate (i.e. genetically based) aversion to cane toads. Another possibility is that our dose rate of thiabendazole within the CTA baits was, in fact, too low; or the result may be an artefact of the non-random assignment of treatment and control groups. Ultimately, there is no way of determining exactly why our outcome occurred without further laboratory/captive trails. Regardless, our study demonstrates a failure of CTA training to mitigate the impact of cane toads on northern quolls in this system.Implications Our result calls into question the value of this approach for conserving quoll populations, at least in its current form. More generally, our results point to the often-unexpected complexities encountered as ideas progress from captive trials to field deployment.},
