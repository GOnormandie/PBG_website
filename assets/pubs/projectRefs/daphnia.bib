	abstract = {The spread of infectious disease is determined by the ability of a pathogen to proliferate within and spread between susceptible hosts. Processes that limit the performance of a pathogen thus occur at two scales: varying with both the availability of energy within a host, and the number of susceptible hosts in a patch. When the rate at which a host intakes and expends energy is density-dependent, these two processes are intimately linked. By modifying how hosts compete for and expend resources, a shift in population density may contribute to differences in the flow of energy in a host–pathogen system, both in terms of the energy available for a host to grow, reproduce and fight infection, as well as the energy available for a pathogen to exploit. Energy flux, therefore, connects the two contrasting scales of within- and between-host dynamics by directly linking the proliferation of a pathogen to the number of hosts circulating within a patch. We use the host Daphnia magna to explore the relationship between energy intake and expenditure at various population densities, as estimated by feeding and metabolic rates respectively. By infecting hosts with the bacterial pathogen Pasteuria ramosa, we then explore how infection changes the relative balance of energy intake and expenditure, and how this energy scope translates into production of transmission spores. Our work demonstrates that energy intake declines at a faster rate with density than does metabolic rate, leaving more excess energy (i.e. discretionary energy) available for both hosts and their dependent pathogens at low population densities. This energetic advantage translates positively into host and pathogen growth, with the production of mature transmission spores benefiting most from correlated changes in host body size, as well as a direct connection between energy scope and spore loads. Our findings reinforce how patch quality for a pathogen operates at two contrasting scales, with the within-host proliferation of a pathogen being optimised in energy rich, low density host populations and opportunities for between-host transmission likely maximised in dense populations.

	abstract = {Understanding the dynamics of biological invasions is crucial for managing numerous phenomena, from invasive species to tumours. While the Allee effect (where individuals in low-density populations suffer lowered ﬁtness) is known to inﬂuence both the ecological and evolutionary dynamics of an invasion, the possibility that an invader’s susceptibility to the Allee effect might itself evolve has received little attention. Since invasion fronts are regions of perpetually low population density, selection should be expected to favour vanguard invaders that are resistant to Allee effects. This may not only cause invasions to accelerate over time, but, by mitigating the Allee effects experienced by the vanguard, also make the invasion transition from a pushed wave, propelled by dispersal from behind the invasion front, to a pulled wave, driven instead by the invasion vanguard. To examine this possibility, we construct an individual-based model in which a trait that governs resistance to the Allee effect is allowed to evolve during an invasion. We ﬁnd that vanguard invaders evolve resistance to the Allee effect, causing invasions to accelerate. This results in invasions transforming from pushed waves to pulled waves, an outcome with consequences for invasion speed, population genetic structure, and other emergent behaviours. These ﬁndings underscore the importance of accounting for evolution in invasion forecasts, and suggest that evolution has the capacity to fundamentally alter invasion dynamics.},

	abstract = {Pathogens often rely on their host for dispersal. Yet, maximizing fitness via replication can cause damage to the host and an associated reduction in host movement, incurring a trade-off between transmission and dispersal. Here, we test the idea that pathogens might mitigate this trade-off between reproductive fitness and dispersal by taking advantage of sexual dimorphism in their host, tailoring responses separately to males and females. Using experimental populations of Daphnia magna and its bacterial pathogen Pasteuria ramosa as a test-case, we find evidence that this pathogen can use male hosts as a dispersal vector, and the larger females as high-quality resource patches for optimized production of transmission spores. As sexual dimorphism in dispersal and body size is widespread across the animal kingdom, this differential exploitation of the sexes by a pathogen might be an unappreciated phenomenon, possibly evolved in various systems.},
