	abstract = {Invasive species are a leading cause of native biodiversity loss. In Australia, the toxic, invasive cane toad Rhinella marina has caused massive and widespread declines of northern quolls Dasyurus hallucatus. Quolls are fatally poisoned if they mistakenly prey on adult toads. To prevent the extinction of this native dasyurid from the Top End, an insurance population was set up in 2003 on two toad-free islands in Arnhem Land. In 2015, quolls were collected from one of these islands (Astell) for reintroduction. We used conditioned taste aversion to render 22 of these toad-naïve quolls toad averse. Seven quolls received no taste aversion training. The source island was also predator-free, so all quolls received very basic predator-aversion training. In an attempt to re-establish the mainland population, we reintroduced these 29 northern quolls into Kakadu National Park in northern Australia where cane toads have been established for 13 years. The difference in survival between toad-averse and toad-naive quolls was immediately apparent. Toad-naive quolls were almost all killed by toads within 3 days. Toad-averse quolls, on the other hand, not only survived longer but also were recorded mating. Our predator training, however, was far less effective. Dingo predation accounted for a significant proportion of toad-smart quoll mortality. In Kakadu, dingoes have been responsible for high levels of quoll predation in the past and reintroduced animals are often vulnerable to predation-mediated population extinction. Dingoes may also be more effective predators in fire degraded landscapes. Together, these factors could explain the extreme predation mortality that we witnessed. In addition, predator aversion may have been lost from the predator-free island populations. These possibilities are not mutually exclusive but need to be investigated because they have clear bearing on the long-term recovery of the endangered northern quoll.},

	abstract = {If bold animals are more likely to be trapped than shy animals, we take a biased sample of personalities—a problem for behavioural research. Such a bias is problematic, also, for population estimation using mark-recapture models that assume homogeneity in detection probabilities. In this study, we investigated whether differences in boldness result in differences in detection probability in a native Australian rodent, the grassland melomys (Melomys burtoni). During a mark-recapture study of this species, we used modified open field tests to assess the boldness (via emergence, and interaction with a novel object) of melomys trapped on the last night of four trapping nights in each of two trapping sessions. Despite melomys showing repeatable variation in these behavioural traits, neither boldness nor emergence latency had an effect on detection probability, and we found no evidence that detection probability varied between individuals. This result suggests that any neophobia is experienced and resolved in individuals of this species on a scale of minutes, rather than the hours across which traps are made available each night. Our work demonstrates that personality-caused sampling bias may not be inevitable, even in situations where animals are required to respond to novelty to be detected, such as in baited traps. Heterogeneity in personality does not inevitably lead to heterogeneity in detection probability.},

	abstract = {When imperilled by a threatening process, the choice is often made to conserve threatened species on offshore islands that typically lack the full suite of mainland predators. While keeping the species extant, this releases the conserved population from predator-driven natural selection. Antipredator traits are no longer maintained by natural selection and may be lost. It is implicitly assumed that such trait loss will happen slowly, but there are few empirical tests. In Australia, northern quolls (Dasyurus hallucatus) were moved onto a predator-free offshore island in 2003 to protect the species from the arrival of invasive cane toads on the mainland. We compared the antipredator behaviours of wild-caught quolls from the predator-rich mainland with those from this predator-free island. We compared the responses of both wild-caught animals and their captive-born offspring, to olfactory cues of two of their major predators (feral cats and dingoes). Wild-caught, mainland quolls recognized and avoided predator scents, as did their captive-born offspring. Island quolls, isolated from these predators for only 13 generations, showed no recognition or aversion to these predators. This study suggests that predator aversion behaviours can be lost very rapidly, and that this may make a population unsuitable for reintroduction to a predator-rich mainland.},

In this study, we explored one critical assumption of these models: that toads cannot persist in the corridor during the dry season without access to artificial water points. We explicitly tested this assumption by translocating and radio-tracking 78 male cane toads in the proposed barrier region during the dry season. Telemetered toads moved substantial distances (maximum distance {\textgreater}2.5 km/night) and were adept at finding shelter. Nonetheless, toads experienced high water loss rates (1.89\%/hr) and rapid mortality in both desert (mean ± SD = 43.6 hr ±1.4) and coastal (24.5 hr ±1.2) habitats. Survival analysis suggested that toads could survive a maximum of 5 days without access to surface water and would move a maximum of 5.35 km in this time. Our results confirm that artificial water points are a critical resource for toads in the proposed barrier region and provide further evidence that the waterless barrier could successfully halt toad expansion in Western Australia.},

	abstract = {The invasion of toxic cane toads (Rhinella marina) is a major threat to northern quolls (Dasyurus hallucatus) which are poisoned when they attack this novel prey item. Quolls are now endangered as a consequence of the toad invasion. Conditioned taste aversion can be used to train individual quolls to avoid toads, but we currently lack a training technique that can be used at a landscape scale to buffer entire populations from toad impact. Broad-scale deployment requires a bait that can be used for training, but there is no guarantee that such a bait will ultimately elicit aversion to toads. Here, we test a manufactured bait – a ‘toad sausage’ – in a small captive trial, for its ability to elicit aversion to toads in northern quolls. To do this, we exposed one group of quolls to a toad sausage and another to a control sausage and compared the quolls' predatory responses when presented with a dead adult toad. Captive quolls that consumed a single toad sausage showed a reduced interest in cane toads, interacting with them for less than half the time of their untrained counterparts and showing reduced Attack behaviour. We also quantified bait uptake in the field, by both quolls and non-target species. These field trials showed that wild quolls were the most frequent species attracted to the baits, and that approx. 61\% of quolls consumed toad-aversion baits when first encountered. Between 40\% and 68\% of these animals developed aversion to further bait consumption. Our results suggest that toad-aversion sausages may be used to train wild quolls to avoid cane toads. This opens the possibility for broad-scale quoll training with toad aversion sausages: a technique that may allow wildlife managers to prevent quoll extinctions at a landscape scale.},

The net impact of parasites depends on their capacity to switch effectively between native and invasive hosts. Here we explore host-switching, spatial patterns and simple fitness measures in a slow-expanding invasion: the invasion of Asian house geckos (Hemidactylus frenatus) from urban areas into bushland in Northeast Australia. In bushland close to urban edges, H. frenatus co-occurs with, and at many sites now greatly out-numbers, native geckos. We measured prevalence and intensity of Geckobia mites (introduced with H. frenatus), and Waddycephalus (a native pentastome). We recorded a new invasive mite species, and several new host associations for native mites and geckos, but we found no evidence of mite transmission between native and invasive geckos. In contrast, native Waddycephalus nymphs were commonly present in H. frenatus, demonstrating this parasite's capacity to utilize H. frenatus as a novel host. Prevalence of mites on H. frenatus decreased with distance from the urban edge, suggesting parasite release towards the invasion front; however, we found no evidence that mites affect H. frenatus body condition or lifespan. Waddycephalus was present at low prevalence in bushland sites and, although its presence did not affect host body condition, our data suggest that it may reduce host survival. The high relative density of H. frenatus at our sites, and their capacity to harbour Waddycephalus, suggests that there may be impacts on native geckos and snakes through parasite spillback.},

Predators also elicit behavioral change in prey populations, via phenotypic plasticity and/or rapid evolution, and such changes may also contribute to trophic cascades. Here, we document rapid demographic and behavioral changes in populations of a prey species (grassland melomys Melomys burtoni, a granivorous rodent) following the introduction of a novel marsupial predator (northern quoll Dasyurus hallucatus). Within months of quolls appearing, populations of melomys exhibited reduced survival and population declines relative to control populations. Quoll-invaded populations were also significantly shyer than nearby, quoll-free populations of conspecifics. This rapid but generalized response to a novel threat was replaced over the following 2 yr with more threat-specific antipredator behaviors (i.e., predator-scent aversion). Predator-exposed populations, however, remained more neophobic than predator-free populations throughout the study. These behavioral responses manifested rapidly in changed rates of seed predation by melomys across treatments. Quoll-invaded melomys populations exhibited lower per-capita seed take rates, and rapidly developed an avoidance of seeds associated with quoll scent, with discrimination playing out over a spatial scale of tens of meters. Presumably the significant and novel predation pressure induced by quolls drove melomys populations to fine-tune behavioral responses to be more predator specific through time. These behavioral shifts could reflect individual plasticity (phenotypic flexibility) in behavior or may be adaptive shifts from natural selection imposed by quoll predation. Our study provides a rare insight into the rapid ecological and behavioral shifts enacted by prey to mitigate the impacts of a novel predator and shows that trophic cascades can be strongly influenced by behavioral as well as numerical responses.},

Northern quolls are endangered by the spread of the invasive cane toad (Rhinella marina), which they are fatally poisoned by, if they mistakenly attempt to consume them. There are, however, a small number of quolls that are “toad-smart”—they possess a heritable trait that means they innately do not attack toads. It is this trait we hoped to promote through targeted gene flow. We established a hybrid population (54 toad-smart and toad-naïve northern quolls) and introduced this population onto a small offshore, toad-infested island in 2017. Genetic data suggests an increase in the toad-smart proportion of the genome increasing from 29.4\% in the release population to 40.2\% in the first island generation (F2). Our data demonstrate successful in situ hybridisation between populations, with viable F2 hybrids and backcrosses observed, and some evidence of heterosis (hybrid vigour) in F1 hybrids. The population experienced significant reductions in size over the two years, however, through a combination of toad-mortality, as well as stochastic processes including fire, a cyclone, predation and ineffective breeding, and so small sample sizes hamper our results. Such establishment problems would not occur were we to attempt targeted gene flow into already established quoll populations, and our observation of successful hybridisation suggests targeted gene flow could be a viable strategy in established quoll populations soon to be impacted by toads.},

	abstract = {Cultural adaptation is one means by which conservationists may help populations adapt to threats. A learned behavior may protect an individual from a threat, and the behavior can be transmitted horizontally (within generations) and vertically (between generations), rapidly conferring population-level protection. Although possible in theory, it remains unclear whether such manipulations work in a conservation setting; what conditions are required for them to work; and how they might affect the evolutionary process. We examined models in which a population can adapt through both genetic and cultural mechanisms. Our work was motivated by the invasion of highly toxic cane toads (Rhinella marina) across northern Australia and the resultant declines of endangered northern quolls (Dasyurus hallucatus), which attack and are fatally poisoned by the toxic toads. We examined whether a novel management strategy in which wild quolls are trained to avoid toads can reduce extinction probability. We used a simulation model tailored to quoll life history. Within simulations, individuals were trained and a continuous evolving trait determined innate tendency to attack toads. We applied this model in a population viability setting. The strategy reduced extinction probability only when heritability of innate aversion was low ({\textless}20\%) and when trained mothers trained {\textgreater}70\% of their young to avoid toads. When these conditions were met, genetic adaptation was slower, but rapid cultural adaptation kept the population extant while genetic adaptation was completed. To gain insight into the evolutionary dynamics (in which we saw a transitory peak in cultural adaptation over time), we also developed a simple analytical model of evolutionary dynamics. This model showed that the strength of natural selection declined as the cultural transmission rate increased and that adaptation proceeded only when the rate of cultural transmission was below a critical value determined by the relative levels of protection conferred by genetic versus cultural mechanisms. Together, our models showed that cultural adaptation can play a powerful role in preventing extinction, but that rates of cultural transmission need to be high for this to occur.},

	abstract = {Islands are increasingly used to protect endangered populations from the negative impacts of invasive species. Quarantine efforts on islands are likely to be undervalued in circumstances in which a failure incurs non-economic costs. One approach to ascribe monetary value to such efforts is by modeling the expense of restoring a system to its former state. Using field-based removal experiments on two different islands off northern Australia separated by {\textgreater} 400 km, we estimate cane toad densities, detection probabilities, and the resulting effort needed to eradicate toads from an island. We use these estimates to conservatively evaluate the financial benefit of cane toad quarantine across offshore islands prioritized for conservation management by the Australian federal government. We calculate density as animals per km of freshwater shoreline, and find striking concordance of density estimates across our two island study sites: a mean density of 352 [289, 466] adult toads per kilometre on one island, and a density of 341 [298, 390] on the second. Detection probability differed between our two study islands (Horan Island: 0.1 [0.07, 0.13]; Indian Island: 0.27 [0.22, 0.33]). Using a removal model and the financial costs incurred during toad removal, we estimate that eradicating cane toads would, on average, cost between \$22 487 [\$14 691, \$34 480] (based on Horan Island) and \$39 724 [\$22 069, \$64 001] AUD (Indian Island) per km of available freshwater shoreline. We estimate the remaining value of toad quarantine across islands that have been prioritized for conservation benefit within the toads’ predicted range, and find the net value of quarantine efforts to be \$43.4 [28.4–66.6] – \$76.7 [42.6–123.6] M depending on which island dataset is used to calibrate the model. We conservatively estimate the potential value of a mainland cane toad containment strategy – to prevent the spread of toads into the Pilbara Bioregion – to be \$80 [52.6–123.4] – \$142 [79.0–229.0] M. We present a modeling framework that can be used to estimate the value of preventative management, via estimating the length and cost of an eradication program. Our analyses suggest that there is substantial economic value in cane toad quarantine efforts across Australian offshore islands and in a proposed mainland containment strategy.},

	abstract = {Understanding the dynamics of biological invasions is crucial for managing numerous phenomena, from invasive species to tumours. While the Allee effect (where individuals in low-density populations suffer lowered ﬁtness) is known to inﬂuence both the ecological and evolutionary dynamics of an invasion, the possibility that an invader’s susceptibility to the Allee effect might itself evolve has received little attention. Since invasion fronts are regions of perpetually low population density, selection should be expected to favour vanguard invaders that are resistant to Allee effects. This may not only cause invasions to accelerate over time, but, by mitigating the Allee effects experienced by the vanguard, also make the invasion transition from a pushed wave, propelled by dispersal from behind the invasion front, to a pulled wave, driven instead by the invasion vanguard. To examine this possibility, we construct an individual-based model in which a trait that governs resistance to the Allee effect is allowed to evolve during an invasion. We ﬁnd that vanguard invaders evolve resistance to the Allee effect, causing invasions to accelerate. This results in invasions transforming from pushed waves to pulled waves, an outcome with consequences for invasion speed, population genetic structure, and other emergent behaviours. These ﬁndings underscore the importance of accounting for evolution in invasion forecasts, and suggest that evolution has the capacity to fundamentally alter invasion dynamics.},

We explore a generic population model as well as a specific example – the northern quoll, an Australian marsupial predator threatened by the toxic cane toad. We reveal a trade-off between preserving the recipient genome and reducing population extinction risk, but key management levers can often optimise this so that nearly 100\% of the recipient population's genome is preserved.

	abstract = {Uptake of baits is a key variable in management actions aimed at the vaccination, training, or control of many vertebrate species. Increasingly, however, it is apparent that individuals of the target species vary in their likelihood of taking baits. To optimize a baiting program, knowledge on the rate of bait uptake, how this rate changes with bait availability, and the proportion of the target population that will take a bait is required. The invasive cane toad (Rhinella marina) in Australia is a major threat to northern quolls (Dasyurus hallucatus), which are poisoned when they attack this novel toxic prey item. Conditioned-taste-aversion baits (cane toad sausages) can be delivered in the field to train northern quolls to avoid toads. We conducted a large-scale field trial among 11 sites across one large property in Western Australia from 19–26 July 2017. We used camera traps and statistical modelling to estimate the proportion of baitable animals in the population, their encounter rate with baits, and survival rate of baits in the environment. Population estimates varied at each site from 2.5 to 16.8 quolls per site, resulting in a range among sites of 0.7–4.6 baits available/individual. Approximately 64\% of individual quolls were bait-susceptible. Both encounter rate and bait survival were low, resulting in our baiting regime treating {\textless}30\% of the bait-susceptible population. Using our model parameters, we estimate that we would need to increase our bait density 6-fold to treat all bait-susceptible individuals in the population. Without accounting for heterogeneity in bait-susceptibility, our model would suggest we would need a 10-fold increase in bait density. Thus, accounting for heterogeneity provides a more efficient baiting design. Data and models such as ours provide wildlife managers with information critical to informed decision-making and are fundamental to estimate the cost-efficiency of any baiting campaign. © 2019 The Wildlife Society.},

We examine this phenomenon using a ten-year longitudinal dataset on a threatened Australian mammal; the woylie (Bettongia penicillata ogilbyi). Behavioural and morphological data were collected during routine monitoring of a havened woylie population and an adjacent wild population where predators occur, from which six traits relating to predator escape were extracted. Paired comparisons revealed that havened woylies were less likely to show injuries from excessive agitation in traps, were less likely to eject pouch young, and had shorter approach distances compared to woylies outside the haven, suggesting a dampened antipredator response. Further, body mass and relative leg length declined over time in the havened population, compared with no change outside of the haven, suggesting selection in the haven against body size. Population density affected body size and agitation in traps differently in havened and non-havened populations, indicating an interaction between resource competition and relaxed selection that likely hastens the loss of anti-predator traits. Our study offers a mechanistic understanding of the loss of anti-predator responses in havens, which is essential for guiding how populations could be managed to better realise their potential for recovering threatened fauna.},

	abstract = {Mammal declines across northern Australia are one of the major biodiversity loss events occurring globally. There has been no regional assessment of the implications of these species declines for genomic diversity. To address this, we conducted a species-wide assessment of genomic diversity in the northern quoll (Dasyurus hallucatus), an Endangered marsupial carnivore. We used next generation sequencing methods to genotype 10,191 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 352 individuals from across a 3220-km length of the continent, investigating patterns of population genomic structure and diversity, and identifying loci showing signals of putative selection. We found strong heterogeneity in the distribution of genomic diversity across the continent, characterized by (i) biogeographical barriers driving hierarchical population structure through long-term isolation, and (ii) severe reductions in diversity resulting from population declines, exacerbated by the spread of introduced toxic cane toads (Rhinella marina). These results warn of a large ongoing loss of genomic diversity and associated adaptive capacity as mammals decline across northern Australia. Encouragingly, populations of the northern quoll established on toad-free islands by translocations appear to have maintained most of the initial genomic diversity after 16 years. By mapping patterns of genomic diversity within and among populations, and investigating these patterns in the context of population declines, we can provide conservation managers with data critical to informed decision-making. This includes the identification of populations that are candidates for genetic management, the importance of remnant island and insurance/translocated populations for the conservation of genetic diversity, and the characterization of putative evolutionarily significant units.},

	abstract = {Gene drives that skew sex ratios offer a new management tool to suppress or eradicate pest populations. Early models and empirical work suggest that these suppression drives can completely eradicate well-mixed populations, but models that incorporate stochasticity and space (i.e. drift and recolonization events) often result in loss or failure of the drive. We developed a stochastic model to examine these processes in a simple one-dimensional space. This simple space allows us to map the events and outcomes that emerged and examine how properties of the drive's wave of invasion affect outcomes. Our simulations, across a biologically realistic section of parameter space, suggest that drive failure might be a common outcome in spatially explicit, stochastic systems, and that properties of the drive wave appear to mediate outcomes. Surprisingly, the drives that would be considered fittest in an aspatial model were strongly associated with failure in the spatial setting. The fittest drives cause relatively fast moving, and narrow waves that have a high chance of being penetrated by wild-types (WTs) leading to WT recolonization, leading to failure. Our results also show that high rates of dispersal reduce the chance of failure because drive waves get disproportionately wider than WT waves as dispersal rates increase. Overall, wide, slow-moving drive waves were much less prone to failure. Our results point to the complexity inherent in using a genetic system to effect demographic outcomes and speak to a clear need for ecological and evolutionary modelling to inform the drive design process.},
